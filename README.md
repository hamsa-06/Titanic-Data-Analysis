# Titanic-Data-Analysis<br>

## Overview<br>
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset using Python. The dataset provides insights into the survival rate based on different parameters like gender, class,<br>
and age. The analysis includes data visualization using pie charts, bar graphs, and histograms.<br>
<br>
## Steps for Analysis<br>
1. **Load Data in Python**<br>
   - Read the Titanic dataset using Pandas.<br>
   
2. **Display Data**<br>
   - Print the first 10 rows and the last 10 rows of the dataset.<br>

3. **Dataset Shape**<br>
   - Display the total number of rows and columns.<br>

4. **Column Names**<br>
   - Print all column names of the dataset.<br>

5. **Data Types**<br>
   - Identify the data types of all columns.<br>

6. **Information and Summary**<br>
   - Print dataset information and generate a statistical summary.<br>

7. **Survival Count Visualization**<br>
   - Count the number of survivors and visualize the data using a pie chart.<br>

8. **Female Passengers in First Class**<br>
   - Count the number of female passengers who traveled in first class and show this on a pie chart.<br>

9. **Female Survivors Under 30**<br>
   - Identify the number of female passengers who survived and were under 30 years old.<br>
   - Visualize the results using a pie chart and a bar graph.<br>

10. **Male Survivors Above 40**
    - Count the number of male passengers who survived and were older than 40.<br>
    - Display the results using a pie chart.<br>

11. **Age Distribution**<br>
    - Display the age distribution using 20 bins.<br>

12. **Age Frequency with Survival Status**<br>
    - Show a histogram for age distribution among survivors and non-survivors.<br>

13. **Survival Rate by Gender and Class**<br>
    - Show a bar graph for survival based on gender and passenger class.<br>

14. **Passenger Count by Class**<br>
    - Display a bar graph showing the number of passengers in each class.<br>

15. **Survival Count by Class**<br>
    - Display a bar graph showing the number of survivors per class.<br>

16. **Subplot for Gender-Class Survival and Class-Wise Passenger Count**<br>
    - Display bar graphs for survival rate by gender and passenger class along with the total passengers per class in a subplot.<br>

17. **Survival Rate for Specific Groups**<br>
    - Show a bar graph for survival in 3rd class male passengers and 1st class female passengers.<br>

18. **Survival of First-Class Female Passengers**<br>
    - Count how many first-class female passengers survived or not.<br>

19. **Mapping Gender Column**<br>
    - Convert 'Sex' column values: Male = 1, Female = 0.<br>

20. **Null Values Detection**<br>
    - Identify missing values in the dataset.<br>

21. **Handling Missing Values**<br>
    - Replace missing values with the median.<br>

22. **Drop Unwanted Columns**<br>
    - Remove irrelevant columns from the dataset.<br>

## Tools and Technologies<br>
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy<br>
- **Visualization Techniques:** Pie charts, Bar graphs, Histograms, Subplots<br>

## How to Run the Analysis<br>
1. Clone this repository.<br>
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy`<br>
3. Run the Python script to execute the analysis.<br>

## Expected Outcomes<br>
- A better understanding of survival trends based on class, gender, and age.<br>
- Graphical representation of survival statistics.<br>
- Cleaned and preprocessed Titanic dataset for further exploration.<br>
